# Ball Collider 
"Ball Collider" allows you to create a captivating simulation of a container filled with bouncing balls that you have the full ability to manipulate. Customize your experience with unique graphical and audio settings to create your own work of art.

Top features include:
- Control the gravity, speed, ball size, number of balls, and more to establish the perfect simulation.
- Modify the rules of your simulation as time passes: make balls grow bigger or smaller, produce more balls, or gain speed!
- Change the appearance of each ball to make the most visually exciting simulation possible.
- Upload custom audio or use built-in audio sets to make the balls play songs, musical notes, or funny noises!
- Watch how your decisions make the simulation morph over time, and see if it will reach equilibrium or devolve into total chaos!
